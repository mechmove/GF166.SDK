# About This Project

This project began as a personal effort to keep legacy GoFlight hardware alive and useful. Over time, it evolved into a clean, simulator‑agnostic SDK built around explicit contracts, predictable behavior, and maintainable architecture.

The goal is simple: provide a solid hardware foundation without dictating how anyone uses it. The SDK handles USB communication, state decoding, and display formatting. Everything else — aircraft logic, simulator behavior, mappings, workflows — belongs to the developer integrating the hardware.

# About the Author

I’m a developer who enjoys making complex systems understandable, maintainable, and occasionally entertaining. I like clean architecture, expressive code, and documentation that doesn’t feel like a tax form. I build things independently and at my own pace, with a focus on clarity and long‑term usefulness.

If you find this SDK helpful, great. If you build something on top of it, even better. Friendly developers are always welcome.
